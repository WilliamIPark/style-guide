                <h2>1. Logo Usage</h2>
                <p>The monogram is an extremely important part of the brand. It represents not only the brand,but me
personally therefore care should be taken in every way to make sure it is recognisable in every state.
Care has been put into making the logo proportional on a grid so it can be recreated and changed
without destroying the essense of the shape.</p>

                    <img class="grid_logo" src="images/Monogram/grid_logo_large.png">
                    <h3>Large Version</h3>
                    <p>The large version of the logo should only be used
in areas where the shape is well defined. For example, on the main logo image on a banner of a website.</p>
                </article>

                    <img class="grid_logo" src="images/Monogram/grid_logo_small.png">
                    <h3>Small Version</h3>
                    <p>The small version should be used in areas where definition of the logo is lost, especially if the gap becomes hard to see. For example, a favicon.</p>
                </article>

                <h3>Logo Usage / Other Usage Restrictions</h3>

                <p><strong>Do not</strong> do any of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colour the logo in a colour that is not listed in the brand's colour palette.</li>
                    <li>Use multiple colours for the logo.</li>
                    <li>Rotate the logo.</li>
                    <li>Resize the logo out of proportion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Brand Colours</h2>
                <p>A consistant colour pallette is something important to the brand. The dark gray and red contrast really well and it stands its ground as a pillar in the brand's design. The main gray (#4F4F4F) and main red (#F22267) are supported by other colours in the same tonal range, which should only be used in moderation. An example for using the other colours include using the lighter grays for toning back some text that is otherwise to strong in the hierarchy. Another example would be to put them in use for interactive elements, such as to create a hover effect for a button.</p>

                <h2>3. Typography</h2>

				<div class="column60">
					<p>Josef Müller-Brockmann lived his life in design, and was a pioneer in objective design - he believed that if design was objective that it would be timeless. This is why I chose Futura as my typeface of choice to support this brand. It is geometric, objective, and in my eyes, timeless. It is easy to read at small sizes and is beautiful at large sizes, and comes with a lot of weights to allow typographic freedom in a single typeface.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column40">
					<div class="sample_text_box">
						<p class="sample_futura_book">Aa</p>
						<p>Futura PT Book</p>
					</div>
					<div class="sample_text_box">
						<p class="sample_futura_heavy">Aa</p>
						<p>Futura PT Heavy</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="clearfix"></div>
				<h2>Typography / Wordmark Usage</h2>
				<div class = "wordmark_box">
					<div class="wordmark_line"></div>
                	<img src="images/Monogram/Monogram_Large_Optimized.svg"/>
                	<h1 class= "wordmark_large">WILLIAMPARK</h1>
            	</div>

				<p>The top of the monogram must be in line with the top of the wordmark, and the same must apply to the bottom. If the
monogram is used in a different location than shown it must be either vertically or horizontally proportional to the
wordmark. If the wordmark does not work in either of these cases, don't use it.</p>

				<h2>Typography / Type Styles</h2>

				<p>I use “Minor Third” on <a href="http://type-scale.com/">type-scale</a> to get the size of my headers and text. Try to follow the font style for the headers
and also the em in relation to other headers, but feel free to modify the base size of the headings to increase or
decrease the size of them all together. I use 18px/1.125em for a base size which you should also use as a starting point if designing for screen and adjust from there if needed.</p>
